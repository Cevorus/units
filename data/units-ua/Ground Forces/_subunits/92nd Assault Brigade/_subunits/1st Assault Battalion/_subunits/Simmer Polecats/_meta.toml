description = "Probably not a drone unit, but a sponsor. SPC Division was a group of Metalist hooligans from Kharkiv. Since the beginning of the invasion many members of the group joined the fight in different units, some in a Special unit of the police, some in the 92nd Brigade, I think some in Kraken. 
Members of the hooligan group wear that patch, but I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly a unit. Maybe yes or maybe no, some guys belonging to known units wore that patch many times. The founder and former commander and Hero of Ukraine (died last year) of the Beshketnyky Sirka unit of the 92nd Brigade also had the patch, it could be a way to identify the group of former members of that group. And there is a drone workshop that one of those guys created (SPC Laboratory), it could be that they use the name SPC Division when their drones are used."
